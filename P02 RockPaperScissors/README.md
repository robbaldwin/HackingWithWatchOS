# Project 2 Hacking with WatchOS

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

The challenges for this project were:

1. Sometimes the question picture shows the same move twice in a row, which can be confusing to the user. Can you write code that ensures the same move never happens twice in a row?

2. Can you adjust newLevel() so that the rock, paper, and scissors buttons switch around each time?
