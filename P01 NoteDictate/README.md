# Project 1 Hacking with WatchOS

## Note Dictate

The challenges for this project were:

1. Try adjusting the table so that note previews show up to three lines of text.

2. Send the total number of notes in contextForSegue(), so you can set the detail title to be something like “Note 1/5”.

3. Add a second button that takes you to a credits screen. You can create a segue to the new screen just like you did with the row – Ctrl-drag from the button to your new interface. It doesn’t need a Swift file behind it, just place a label with your custom credits text and style it however you want.
